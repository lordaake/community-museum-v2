                                In addition to these exhibits, the Energetica exhibition also features a variety of
                                other interactive displays, including a "smart grid" that shows how electricity is
                                transmitted and distributed, and a "power play" area where visitors can experiment with
                                generating electricity using different sources.
                            </p>

                                The night started with a presentation by Dr. Lisa Anderson, an expert astronomer from
                                the nearby university. Dr. Anderson gave a fascinating talk about the latest discoveries
                                in astronomy, including the search for habitable planets outside of our solar system,
                                the mysteries of black holes, and the hunt for dark matter. After the presentation,
                                attendees were treated to a guided tour of the museum's observatory, where they were
                                able to view the stars and planets through a high-powered telescope. Expert astronomers
                                were on hand to answer questions and provide insights into what was being seen through
                                the telescope. As the night progressed, attendees were also able to participate in a
                                variety of fun and interactive activities, including a "build your own rocket" workshop,
                                a star-gazing scavenger hunt, and even a virtual reality experience that took them on a
                                journey through the universe.
